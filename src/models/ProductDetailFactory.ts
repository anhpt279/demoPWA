      "Tuscan Style CantaloupesI have several listings of Different Kinds of melons and they are ALL Delicious!!!!<br/>Tuscan Style Cantaloupes Dig into the full, rich flavor, the brilliant orange color and the sweetness you won’t find anywhere else.<br/> Filled with Vitamin C and antioxidants, these melons are simply outstanding. Look for the distinctive grooves year-round to help you find the perfect cantaloupe.<br/> The Extra Sweet Tuscan Style Cantaloupe is distinguished by its deep-grooved outer appearance and full-flavored, super-sweet, juicy fruit inside.<br/>The exterior grooves change color from dark green to golden-cream as the fruit ripens, so both produce managers and consumers know when the fruit is optimal for their specific taste.<br/>The Tuscan Cantaloupe is a variety with Italian origins — thus, its name — so it shares many of the qualities of the European cantaloupes.<br/>Among those qualities are the sweet aroma, rich flavor and distinct exterior grooves — these grooves are actually an indicator of flavor and ripeness.<br/>This is a very sweet melon that makes an excellent breakfast or brunch addition, is excellent with ham or prosciutto and is surprisingly satisfying in a summertime salad.",

    productDescription:
      "Big delicious chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough surrounded by creamy vanilla ice cream.<br/>It seems like such a no-brainer today, but in 1984 it was revolutionary.<br/>The Cookie Dough you know and love started with a simple suggestion: What if you put chunks of chocolate chip cookie dough into vanilla ice cream?<br/>That was the amazing anonymous idea submitted way back in the early days of our first Burlington, Vermont, USA, Scoop Shop.<br/>We used to have a bulletin board where people could suggest new flavors for Jerry and Ben to make—and this idea stood out.<br/>The folks at the Scoop Shop immediately went to work mixing up a batch of Cookie Dough.<br/>It was an instant hit. Initially, the flavor was only available at the Scoop Shop.<br/>When we decided to sell it in tubs, we had to figure out how to get that familiar cookie-dough taste, consistency and texture at ice cream temperatures.<br/>We teamed up with Rhino Foods and, over an incredible six-year journey, we perfected the cookie dough found in our tubs today.<br/>In 1991, Cookie Dough began appearing in freezer aisles everywhere. It has remained one of our most popular and beloved flavors ever since! Ben and Jerry's ice cream is made with non-GMO sourced ingredients, cage-free eggs, and we get our cocoa, sugar and vanilla from Fairtrade certified producers.<br/>We also use responsibly sourced packaging. So dig in!",
